# rocket-scripts

This package includes scripts and configurations used to power all Rocketseat's react apps.

## Tests

As rocket-scripts can be used with both javascript and typescript files, it is necessary to configure based on what you're using.

To use the tests with rocket-scripts it is necessary to configure the enzyme with the following packages:

### Javascript

```
yarn add enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 -D
```

### Typescript:

```
yarn add enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 @types/enzyme @types/enzyme-adapter-react-16 -D
```

And add the file `src/setupTests.ts` with the basic settings below:

```ts
import Enzyme from "enzyme";
import Adapter from "enzyme-adapter-react-16";

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

## Merging configurations

You can merge the default settings with your own.

### Jest

Create a file named jest.config.js and export an object with the settings you want to change.
